Customer Service Performance Analysis

Explanation of Data:
1. Call Handling Efficiency: We can analyze how quickly agents answer calls (Speed of Answer) and how this correlates with call resolution and customer satisfaction.
2. Agent Performance: By examining data for individual agents, we can determine which agents are most effective in resolving issues quickly and earning higher satisfaction ratings.
3. Departmental Analysis: The dataset includes multiple departments (Washing Machine, Air Conditioner, etc.), allowing us to compare performance and issue resolution across departments.
4. Customer Satisfaction: By analyzing the satisfaction rating, we can derive insights into which factors (e.g., Speed of Answer, Average Talk Duration, or Resolved status) have the most significant impact on customer satisfaction.
   
Potential Insights:
1. Impact of Speed of Answer on Satisfaction: Faster response times may lead to higher satisfaction ratings.
2. Agent Productivity: Identifying top-performing agents based on the number of calls handled, resolution rates, and satisfaction scores.
3. Departmental Efficiency: Which departments have the most or least resolved calls, and how does this affect overall satisfaction?
4. Unresolved Calls Analysis: Investigating the reasons behind unresolved calls and their impact on satisfaction.
